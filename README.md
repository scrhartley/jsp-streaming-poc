# JSP Streaming Proof-of-Concept

Proof-of-concept of HTML streaming in [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) implemented for JSP web page templating.  
This is a port of my FreeMarker proof-of-concept, but uses different types of Futures, rather than also supporting Callables.

The problem with normal MVC is that when a user visits a web page,
nothing happens until all the data has been collected and the server responds with the HTML page.
In order to shorten that wait, this repo takes the strategy of starting to send HTML to the user before all the data is ready.  
This provides the following benefits:
- The browser can start downloading assets sooner (JS/CSS/images)
    - Assets can download simultaneously with the HTML, improving total page load time and indirectly [TTI](https://web.dev/tti/)
- The user can see parts of the page being rendered, rather than staring at a blank page
  ([TTFB](https://web.dev/ttfb/), [FCP](https://web.dev/fcp/) and potentially [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/))

## Endpoints


### Page loading alternatives
- `/load/traditional` ***Traditional page load***  
  Loads page in the traditional MVC manner, assembling the data before running the template.  
  The user has to wait for everything to be finished before anything can be shown.  
  The browser can not start loading any CSS and JS in the HTML's head until the template has finished running.


- `/load/streaming` ***HTML Streaming (with auto-flushing)***  
  Load page incrementally using streaming, sending pending HTML while waiting for the next piece of data.  
  The user will see each piece of the page as soon as it's ready.  
  (See `/atoms` example for refining this.)


- `/load/head-first` ***Manual flushing example (still using streaming)***  
  Use manual flushing in the template to send the HTML head before the rest of the page.  
  In this example, although the browser can download JS and CSS assets earlier,
  the user still does not see anything until the entire page is ready. This could be improved by additional manual flushes,
  but as the complexity of a template grows, this approach seems less convenient and more error-prone.


### Interleaved vs. Concurrent Execution

These types of execution contrast with the standard MVC pattern of assembling all the data before running the template.

- `/blocking-futures/basic`, `/blocking-futures/dependencies` ***Interleaved execution***  
  These are example implementations using special Futures that don't run in separate threads.  
  When a value is accessed in the template, its Future's wrapped Callable is invoked in a blocking manner.  
  This approach interleaves running the template and fetching data.  
  As well as the basic endpoint, an additional endpoint shows how data dependencies can be managed in the Controller.


- `/futures/basic`, `/futures/dependencies` ***Concurrent execution***  
  These are example implementations using Futures.  
  When a value is accessed in the template, a blocking wait is done for its Future's result.  
  When blocking on the Future being accessed, the execution of other Futures continues concurrently.  
  As well as the basic endpoint, an additional endpoint shows how data dependencies can be managed in the Controller.


### Additional tags

- `/atoms` ***Atom tag***  
  If you're unhappy about where auto-flushing occurs, then this can be refined using the atom tag.  
  This example is a refinement of the behaviour in the `/load/streaming` endpoint (and it's template).


- `/error-boundaries` ***Error boundary tag***  
  An alternative to JSP's catch JSTL tag, providing a more declarative and flexible way
  to show fallback content for a part of the page when an error occurs.  
  Inspiration: https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary


- `/suspend` ***Suspend tag***  
  Builds upon atom to show a loading indicator until its content is complete.
  If JavaScript is not available, then the loading indicator/fallback will not be shown.
  Perhaps this tag is less useful when using concurrency, since it can only show one
  loading indicator at a time and other pending data may complete at roughly the same time.
  For this reason it is not called suspense and a proper out-of-order version
  may not be feasible with JSP.  
  If you wish to use suspend and error boundary together then, unlike React,
  the error boundary should be inside the suspend and not the other way round.  
  Inspiration: https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense


- `/deferred` ***Deferred and trigger deferred tags (EXPERIMENTAL)***  
  Deferred allows multiple loading indicators by queuing the evaluation of content until triggerDeferred is invoked.  
  This pair of tags requires JavaScript to work. The triggerDeferred tag processes
  the queued content in order and so slower deferred content can hold up quicker deferred content.
  The context of each deferred is not retained and so while each fallback will work as expected,
  its queued body will have the context of where the triggerDeferred was invoked,
  as if the deferred body's content was defined at the location of the triggerDeferred.  
  Both deferred and triggerDeferred are implemented as custom Java tags.


## Notes

### Error handling

Since potential exceptions are deferred, error handling is different from traditional MVC pages.  
This provides an opportunity to more easily have parts of the page fail independently (e.g. using error boundaries).  
See `JspConfig` for a way unhandled errors are dealt with, closer to traditional MVC.
This strategy could perhaps be replaced by something that manipulates the page by emitting JavaScript in script tags. 

### Java Version

The code in this project related to JSP and its Spring integration is written to compile under JDK 8.
However, the project was switched to Java 9 in order to be able to use `CompletableFuture#failedFuture`
in the example service using Spring async. If JDK 8 and failedFuture is required, you could instead use:
```
public static <T> CompletableFuture<T> failedFuture(Throwable ex) {
    CompletableFuture<T> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
    future.obtrudeException(ex);
    return future;
}
```

### Easter eggs

- `AsyncModel` extends the Spring `Model` interface and streamlines adding a `Future` to a model,
which would otherwise require injecting an `ExecutorService` into every controller that wished to do so.


- While the provided `LazyDirectExecutorService` already avoids threads (providing deferred execution but giving up 
concurrency), it should also be possible to use something like Guava's [DirectExecutorService](https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/MoreExecutors.html#newDirectExecutorService())
to somewhat simulate traditional MVC behaviour and perform all the execution in the controller. 
This may be useful for comparison purposes:
  - `DirectExecutorService` provides neither deferred execution nor concurrency.
  - `LazyDirectExecutorService`, provides deferred execution but not concurrency.
  - `Executors` offers instances of `ExecutorService` providing both deferred execution and concurrency. 


### Warnings and Troubleshooting

- HTTP streaming may not work if your servers are configured incorrectly. For notes on buffering and Nagle's algorithm see:
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/improving-performance-with-http-streaming-ba9e72c66408
- Any increase of concurrency in your application may lead to increased demand for database connections.
  Make sure that your connection pooling and database are tuned accordingly.
